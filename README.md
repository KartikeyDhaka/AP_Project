# AP_Project
We implemented the two-player (1 vs 1) game mode where players face off on hilly terrain,
taking turns firing bombs at one another. Players get a limited fuel ration per turn and
are allowed to position themselves for a better shot. They can gain weapon upgrades by random 
airdrops and must shoot at one another until one of their tanks is destroyed. We used the libGDX
to make the game. 

We first use JUnit testing to check whether the program runs or not if it runs successfully the 
code runs else throws an error. To implement this we used thread to run the program parallelly. 
We even used serialization to save the data. In the end, we used different screens and classes 
to achieve the working prototype of the game. Tanks classes to implement the movement of the tank, 
bullet class to inflict damage, and other different classes which inherited these classes to run
the program. Buttons used to go to different screens and we even handled fuel and damage to a tank 
and bullet. Selecting different tanks were also handled. We used different OOPS concepts like 
polymorphism, composition, association, dependency, abstract class, inheritance, and many more.
